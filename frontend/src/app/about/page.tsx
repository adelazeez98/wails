                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    My journey into the world of technology began at the age of 17, where I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. This early exposure sparked a deep curiosity for how systems communicate, building a strong foundation in both frontend logic and backend development. I've since built upon that foundation with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering from Tishreen University, where I specialized in Computer Networks and Systems. There, I developed a strong command of networking fundamentals—including routing, switching, and security—and brought those concepts to life by building a real-time backup system in Python for my graduation project.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    My passion lies at the intersection of development and infrastructure. I enjoy the logic of code as well as the structure of networks, which I continue to explore through a Master's program in Network Technologies. My hands-on experience ranges from simulating complex network topologies in Cisco Packet Tracer to providing direct IT support and troubleshooting at a gaming center. I am now eager to apply this unique blend of web development knowledge, programming skills, and network engineering expertise to solve real-world challenges as part of a forward-thinking team.
